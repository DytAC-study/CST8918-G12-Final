# Test Workflow Trigger 2

This file is created to test the workflow after fixing the namespace issues and resource constraints.

## Changes Made:
1. Fixed namespace references in workflow from `default` to `weather-app`
2. Removed unnecessary deployments to free up CPU resources:
   - gatekeeper-audit
   - gatekeeper-controller  
   - azure-policy
   - azure-policy-webhook

## Expected Results:
- All jobs should complete successfully
- Deploy app should work without timeout
- Health check should pass
- Application should be accessible

## Test Date: 2025-07-30
